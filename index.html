        Hello! My name is Bryson Taylor and I am 16 years old. I am a Junior in highshchool and I attend the school at Marygrove. I aspire to be a scientist who specializes in biology, zoology, and environmental science. I've always loved animals, when I was younger I would love to watch animal documenteries and read animal books. when me and my family would go to parks I would try to look for animals.

   I attend a lab called Ecotek Lab where we conduct experiments based on our topic of interest. I've done studies on using algae to get rid of plastic, and designed autonomous vehicles to help aid parts. I've also attended several biology camps in my lifetime. I attended a camp in the summer of 2022 called the Hidden Genius project whose mission is "The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors Black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities." The link to Ecotek Lab and the Hidden Genius Project is below their website is below:
